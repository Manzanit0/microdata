At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Use the [elixir formatter](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/master/Mix.Tasks.Format.html); don't upset the linter.
* Write a [good commit message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/) (we use the AngularJS conventions).
